# Data Scraper Example

**Note:**

It is not recommended to use data scraping for third party sites (like this example actually shows) for general-purpose applications. Sites can change their DOM representations at any time, so the preferred approach is interfacing with an appropriate data API instead. This technique is useful only for legacy sites that have structured data rendered in the DOM, which will do not have a data API and will not be updated.
